Simple health app that shows multiple type of health data from the 
[`HealthService`](https://developer.getpebble.com/docs/c/preview/Foundation/Event_Service/HealthService/)
API. Use the Up and Down buttons to cycle through each type of data item.

> Note: On Aplite, using the API will trigger a prompt to inform the user that
> Pebble Health is not available.
